            human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions
            in a humanlike manner. By extension, robotics is the engineering discipline dealing with
            the design, construction, and operation of robots.

            history (see automaton), but the modern term robot derives from the Czech word robota
            (“forced labour” or “serf”), used in Karel Čapek’s play R.U.R. (1920).
